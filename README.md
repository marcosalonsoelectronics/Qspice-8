Available at: https://youtu.be/2dgrHmCCqJo

In this video we finish the design of our current-mode push-pull converter by implementing a soft start, testing the converter under load and line step transient, adding an auxiliary ramp for stabilizing the operation of the converter at low input voltage, and finally we design and test the auxiliary power supply.
This video is a continuation of previous videos Qspice #6 and Qspice #7.
